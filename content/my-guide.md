1. prompting to create quartz : ) 

```
create quartz obsidian website : ) and run it locally and when i say then commit it to github too then i would configure it to use github pages and also make sure use latest version for deployment (your cutoff date giives error for the depdencies)

- also install node.js or github cli through your terminal or more!
```

2. then telling it to run locally and it would just run itself : )

3. only if want to test locally then else anytime you can upload it to github pages too : )

4. be careful of rm -rf if kept file protection then no issue else could delete everything!
