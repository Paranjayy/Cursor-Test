# Real World Examples üíº

Let's apply SQL to solve actual business problems! These examples simulate real-world scenarios you'll encounter.

## üè™ E-commerce Analytics

### Sales Performance Dashboard

```sql
-- Daily sales summary with key metrics
SELECT 
    DATE(order_date) as sales_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers,
    COUNT(order_id) as total_orders,
    SUM(total_amount) as daily_revenue,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value,
    SUM(total_amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as revenue_per_customer
FROM orders 
WHERE order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(order_date)
ORDER BY sales_date DESC;
```

### Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)

```sql
-- Recency, Frequency, Monetary analysis

    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), MAX(order_date)) as recency_days,

        SUM(total_amount) as monetary_value
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
rfm_scores AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        recency_days,
        frequency,
        monetary_value,
        CASE 
            WHEN recency_days <= 30 THEN 5
            WHEN recency_days <= 90 THEN 4

## üí° Key Patterns for Real-World SQL

1. **Use CTEs** for complex logic breakdown
2. **Window functions** for rankings and running totals
3. **Date functions** for time-based analysis
4. **CASE statements** for business logic
5. **Proper indexing** for performance
6. **Data validation** and null handling
